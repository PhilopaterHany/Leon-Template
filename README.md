# Leon-Template-One
<ul>
  <li>My First Responsive HTML &amp; CSS Webpage ! <br /></li>
  <li>You can view the template's PSD file through this <a href="https://www.graphberry.com/item/leon-psd-agency-template" target="_blank">link</a>. It is <b>free</b> !</li>
  <li>Maybe I'll add some JavaScript later. <br /></li>
  <li>Simple Website for a web developing agency. <br /></li>
  <li>Works well on all devices. <br /></li>
  <li>Took around 9 hours. <br /></li>
  <li>I considered it as a practice material to apply what I have learned till now. <br /></li>
  <li>You can view it live through this <a href="https://rafay-leon-template.netlify.app/" target="_blank">link</a>.</li>
  <li>I hope you like it. <br /></li>
