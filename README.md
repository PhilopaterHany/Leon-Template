# Leon-Template
- My First Responsive HTML &amp; CSS Webpage !
- You can view the template's PSD file through this [link](https://www.graphberry.com/item/leon-psd-agency-template). It is free !
- Maybe I'll add some JavaScript later.
- Simple Website for a web developing agency.
- Works well on all devices &amp; browser friendly.
- Took around 9 hours.
- I considered it as a practice material to apply what I have learned in HTML5 and CSS3.
- You can view it live through this [link](https://philopaterhany.github.io/Leon-Template).
- Special Thanks to [Osama Elzero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAzHSjcR-HnW9tnxyuye8KbF)
